                    <h2>Introduction to Educational Outreach</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>One of the key insights which we have gained over the course of our project is that
                        there is a general lack of awareness among the general public in India regarding the
                        issues of climate change and carbon capture. This notion was seconded in our meet
                        with a known climate activist who said that the single biggest roadblock for climate
                        change is the lack of knowledge and ignorance of the general public towards these
                        issues. Hence, we decided to make sure that we reach out to as many people as
                        possible through our various educational outreach programmes to show them the
                        effects of climate change while also showing how they can help and pursue the
                        various career prospects in Biotechnology.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p><strong>About:</strong> We conducted the INYAS (Indian Young Academy of Sciences)
                        session hosted by professor Arnab Dutta on 7th of June, 2024 in IITB Campus and this
                        was based on CCUS and BECCS</p>
                    <p>We kicked off the session by introducing iGEM, explaining its role in fostering
                        synthetic biology innovations across the globe. This set the stage for a deeper dive
                        into the field of synthetic biology, where we explored its goals, applications, and
                        how it serves as a useful tool in solving real-world problems. Our focus then
                        shifted to the climate crisis, where we laid out the gravity of the situation,
                        delving into the causes and factors contributing to this global challenge. We
                        emphasized topics such as the carbon footprint, providing concrete examples to help
                        the audience grasp the extent of environmental degradation. Following this, we
                        introduced carbon capture as a potential solution to the climate crisis, detailing
                        the various methods used, particularly Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage
                        (CCUS) and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). We critically
                        discussed the advantages and limitations of existing solutions, ultimately leading
                        into a presentation of our own innovative approach to carbon capture through
                        synthetic biology. The session concluded with a lively Q&amp;A segment, where
                        students posed insightful questions that our team eagerly addressed. We also made
                        sure to tell the students about career prospects in the field of Biotech.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> By presenting the complexities of the climate crisis in a
                        clear and relatable manner, we were able to broaden students' understanding of
                        environmental issues and the potential of scientific solutions like CCUS and BECCS.
                        This interaction not only increased awareness about the climate crisis but also
                        fostered an interest in research and innovation among the attendees</p>

                    <p>In a college with technology in its name, it is natural for there to be an abundance
                        of young tech, AI and ML enthusiasts. The application of this in diagnostics and
                        healthcare is reaching new heights in this generation. To let B.Tech students take a
                        peek at what this intersection has in store for them, we organized this AI
                        Transformations in healthcare session in collaboration with the BioX Club. The
                        various speakers talking about their experiences and expertise in this served as
                        motivation for students to try applying their skills in biology through the BSBE and
                        KCDH departments of IIT Bombay, something which most students don’t get a chance to
                        explore. We wanted to use this session as a platform to make students more aware of
                        the field of Biology and its intersection with skills which are used regularly in
                        maths, physics and engineering disciplines.</p>

                    <p><strong>About:</strong> We designed and conducted the SynBio101 course, which ran
                        from June 27, 2024, for four weeks. This course was designed to introduce
                        participants to the exciting and rapidly growing field of synthetic biology, a field
                        that allows for the redesigning of organisms for useful purposes by programming them
                        to perform new tasks.</p>
                    <p>The course aimed to provide participants with a strong foundation in engineering
                        biological systems, while emphasizing how these innovations can be used to tackle
                        global challenges like climate change, food security, and human health.</p>
                    <p>The curriculum was structured to cover key topics over four weeks: <br>Week 1:
                        Introduction to Synthetic Biology <br> Week 2: Fundamentals of Molecular Biology
                        <br> Week 3: Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology <br> Week 4: Conclusion and
                        Final Project
                    </p>
                    <p>Participants dedicated 4-5 hours per week to engaging in course content, which
                        included lectures, readings, and hands-on projects. Weekly quizzes, a mid-course
                        assignment, and a final project were used to evaluate their understanding and ensure
                        active participation throughout the course. Upon successful completion, participants
                        earned a certificate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> IIT Bombay does not have a UG program for Biotechnology.
                        Thus, this course was an effective way of introducing students to synthetic biology
                        and iGEM. This also opened their eyes to the power of biotechnology in addressing
                        complex problems, from environmental sustainability to healthcare advancements.
                        Students not only gained a deeper understanding of genetic engineering and
                        biotechnology but also developed critical thinking skills as they explored potential
                        applications for synthetic biology. The course helped foster a sense of innovation
                        and problem-solving among participants. The course was an effective way to bridge
                        the gap between advanced scientific concepts and young learners, enabling them to
                        take an active role in their biology-based interests.</p>

                    <p>We took an orientation session for the freshers of IIT Bombay. This session was an
                        introduction for freshers to the iGEM Team of IIT Bombay. Our team members
                        introduced them to the various aspects of iGEM as a competition and the work we had
                        done so far. This helped us to expose a lot of students to the world of Synthetic
                        Biology and inspired them to pursue their latent interest in the subject. We also
                        had demonstrations of gel electrophoresis, microscopes, GFP E.coli along with a
                        poster presentation about CalciCapture for them and one on one interactions with
                        them to address their queries and make them aware of the exposure they’ll get
                        through the iGEM competition.</p>

                    <p><strong>About:</strong> As part of our educational outreach, we had the opportunity
                        to interact with professors from IIT Jodhpur who were keen to understand the tech
                        culture at IIT Bombay. During the discussion, we highlighted how the collaborative
                        environment and robust ecosystem at IITB have been instrumental in fostering
                        innovation and interdisciplinary projects, such as our iGEM team. We shared our
                        journey of forming a new iGEM team at IIT Bombay and how the various resources on
                        campus, including access to labs, guidance from faculty, and mentorship from
                        seniors, were pivotal in helping us embark on this ambitious journey.</p>
                    <p>Our team’s focus on developing a CCUS technology using marine algae reflects how IIT
                        Bombay’s ecosystem encourages students to tackle global challenges. The support we
                        received, from ideation to execution, underlined the university’s commitment to
                        fostering innovation in synthetic biology, particularly through initiatives like
                        iGEM. The professors from IIT Jodhpur were particularly interested in how this model
                        of interdisciplinary collaboration can be replicated at their own institute.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact: </strong>By sharing our experience with the IIT Jodhpur professors,
                        we hope to inspire more institutions to adopt a culture that encourages
                        participation in global competitions like iGEM. This interaction also opened up
                        possibilities for future collaborations, allowing us to expand the impact of our
                        educational outreach initiatives.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Our group of stakeholders for this problem was quite diverse, since climate crisis
                        affects each and every person regardless of their socio-economic and geographic
                        backgrounds.<br> The Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas (CTARA) is a
                        body in our institute that focuses on helping technology and innovation reach rural
                        communities and spread awareness about various scientific domains within the
                        country. Hence we approached Prof. Anand B. Rao to understand the context of climate
                        change within the urban and rural areas.</p>
                    <p>We wanted to know how we could conduct effective educational outreach sessions in the
                        rural regions of India. The main issue that we identified was the language barrier.
                        Since India is a multilingual country, communication in English is a tough challenge
                        for many locals, especially in villages. Using their local languages, we will be
                        able to effectively convey our scientific learnings and start fruitful discussions.
                        Thus we decided to translate our outreach resources into local languages and make
                        use of the diversity within our own team to help us increase the reach of our
                        project. </p>

                        innovative activity which engaged these students in our session. We have also made
                        an online version of this booklet available in multiple languages. This booklet will
                        be a helpful for future iGEM Teams and would be resourceful for them in conducting

                    <p>The team organized an interactive session on carbon capture technologies by inviting
                        Prof. Arnab Dutta from the Department of Chemistry who works on bio-inspired
                        catalyst design to capture CO2. In the session, he gave an overview of the climate
                        crisis and why it affects each and every person on the planet. He talked about the
                        various existing CCUS technologies and how they work and what their limitations are.
                        To make the session engaging we also had a live demonstration of a CO2 capture
                        experiment where alkaline water was used in which air was purged to dissolve the
                        CO2. Then calcium carbonate was made by adding calcium ions to it. Students were
                        also given a chance to work on the setup. This was followed by a QnA session to
                        solve any doubts held by the students. The session helped the audience understand
                        the current research being done and what challenges still remain in this field.</p>

                    <p>WiSE stands for Women in Science and Engineering. <br>Most STEM fields tend to be
                        male-dominated. A prime example is our own college with a female to male gender
                        ratio of 1:4 and it is necessary for us to make sure that women also feel
                        comfortable in joining such fields. This was done through this session as it showed
                        how there are endless opportunities. One of our team members, Kadambari Bhide held
                        the session. Our aim was to motivate junior undergraduate females to join and
                        explore more such opportunities in STEM. Examples of pioneering women in biotech
                        were given for inspiring people while Kadambari shared her own insightful
                        experiences to motivate the students. We also gave small fun demonstrations to
