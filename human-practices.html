                <h3>Survey</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>In our iGEM Team’s Integrated Human Practices,
                  we prioritize a collaborative and reflective approach. Our project is built on the belief that
                  sustainable solutions must be shaped by a wide range of perspectives,
                  which is why we actively sought input from industry experts and stakeholders across various fields
                  concerned with our project. We conducted a comprehensive survey involving participants from various
                  age groups,
                  aiming to gather a broad understanding of public perceptions regarding climate change and
                  environmental solutions. The survey revealed that a majority of respondents acknowledged the
                  significant impact of the climate crisis on both the environment and society. In terms of action
                  priorities,
                  the survey results emphasized reducing fossil fuel consumption,
                  increasing investment in renewable energy and protecting forests. Interestingly,
                  when it came to the implementation of genetic engineering for environmental solutions,
                  there was clear skepticism along with a notable lack of awareness around technologies such as carbon
                  capture and storage,
                  as well as the specific role of coccolithophores in the global carbon cycle.</p>

                <p><strong>Description of person: </strong>Ridhima is a young environmental activist who has advocated
                  for action against climate change. She was also part of the 2019 UN Climate Action
                  Summit.<br><strong>Reason for approach: </strong>Our main reason for interviewing her was to realise
                  the challenges we could face in our project as a climate crisis solution,
                  learn from her journey,
                  and what has kept her motivated through the challenges that have come her way. We also discussed the
                  major climate issues faced in India and the existing solutions,
                  such as renewable energy sources and zero waste policies,
                  for this.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>On the question of why India needs to improve in
                  tackling these issues,
                  she said that people generally do not take it seriously. The lack of awareness and ignorance just adds
                  fuel to the fire.. Raising our voices and encouraging and asking the decision-makers to take action is
                  essential in this fight. Her major point was to be the change you want to see in the world. These
                  words hold great significance for the younger generation,
                  who will grow up in a time when climate issues are causing severe harm to the world. Taking action now
                  will make the world a better place for them.<br><strong>Integration in the project: </strong>Her words
                  were an inspiration to us and have thus motivated us to conduct many such informative sessions
                  regarding the climate crisis and approaches such as synthetic biology targeted towards school and
                  college students,
                  involving relevant professors and organisations as well.</p>

                <p><strong>Reason for approach: </strong>Our team interacted with various distinguished alumni of the
                  Biosciences and Bioengineering Department at IIT Bombay to discuss the idea of our project and get
                  valuable feedback during our ideation phase.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>We were able to
                  learn about the current challenges in the bioengineering domain and what the industry needs from
                  students like us. The team got to also know about which fields are currently in the focus of research
                  and development. We were guided on how we could come up with efficient biosystems that have high
                  scalability and adaptability to serve diverse needs. This event also helped us get contacts of domain
                  experts to seek guidance along the progress of the project.</p>

                      phase of team formation,
                      with most of our members being from the chemical engineering department,
                      we visited the ChemTech World Expo. Bioreactors are the primary intersection between chemical
                      engineering and biotechnology. To get an industrial viewpoint while ideating our problem
                      statement,
                      considering possible upscaling of the solution we’d create and how things work in such a set up is
                      why we visited the expo. We wanted to gain an industrial perspective of carbon capture through
                      this experience so that we could incorporate any considerations that we learned into our
                      project.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>This visit was a great way for members of our team
                      to gain exposure to the industrial perspective of bioreactors and interacting with industry

                <p><strong>Description of person: </strong>Dr. Shamlan M. S. Reshamwala is a professor at the Institute
                  of Chemical Technology,
                  Mumbai with expertise in recombinant proteins,
                  enzyme engineering and bioprospecting to explore metabolic diversity.<br><strong>Reason for approach:
                  </strong>We approached him to understand the challenges that may be involved in working with a novel
                  organism like E. huxleyi and how to go about this process in a systematic manner.<br><strong>Inputs
                    received: </strong>In our meeting with the professor,
                  several challenges and strategic directions for our project were discussed. One of the key insights
                  was that deploying our solution in marine environments presents challenges,
                  which limits us to coastal regions. To move forward,
                  we will need to acquire the E. huxleyi strain and obtain the necessary research tools under a research
                  license,
                  which will allow us to explore the organism in depth. We were also told by the professor that Plasmids
                  are hard to acquire. He also suggested using a directed evolution approach to acclimatize the E.
                  huxleyi strain to higher temperatures by gradually increasing it by 1°C,
                  ensuring adaptability to varying conditions. For media engineering,
                  a design of experiments approach was recommended,
                  involving multiple runs to identify critical parameters. A detailed CO2 absorption study was proposed,
                  beginning with a control test in an alkaline medium,
                  followed by experiments with the algae to measure the CO2 difference through titration. Furthermore,
                  the importance of reviewing publications on the genetic engineering of E. huxleyi and obtaining
                  plasmids from sources like AddGene was highlighted. Another potential avenue is creating a synthetic
                  organelle for calcification,
                  with examples like diol toxins in Salmonella. However,
                  a realistic approach is essential,
                  and overly undefined systems,
                  like attempting to create synthetic coccolith vesicles,
                  may not be practical as we do not have enough information about it. Thus this meeting gave us a very
                  good overview of the complexities we might encounter in our project and how we could navigate around
                  them using innovative implementation. Post this meeting we decided to discuss the implementation of
                  his inputs with our Prof. Balaji from our college.</p>

                    <p><br><strong>Description: </strong>Dr. PV Balaji is the current head of the Department of
                      Biosciences and Bioengineering at IIT Bombay. His research is focused on computational biology and
                      bioinformatics.<br><strong>Reason for approach: </strong>We approached him to discuss the insights
                      we had gained from some of our past meetings with Academicians. We also wanted to get his guidance
                      on how to implement some of the key ideas we had learnt uptill now.<br><strong>Inputs received:
                      </strong>The professor advised us that working with overly undefined systems like the metabolism
                      of E. huxleyi is a very tricky task. He said that although the idea of creating a synthetic
                      organelle is novel and exciting,
                      it is important for us as a team to be realistic in our ideation and do feasibility checks. He
                      iterated on the importance of studying the functioning of CaM since it would determine the main
                      step of an understudied system. This would help us make a foundational advance and create avenues
                      for collaboration with future iGEM teams. This meeting helped us understand the complexities
                      involved in modifications of biological systems and how we must take a grounded approach while
                      designing our solution. We also increased our focus on studying CaM and figuring out its role in
                      the calcium pathway of our algae.</p>

                <p><strong>Description of person: </strong>Dr. Bera is a professor in the Department of Biotechnology at
                  the Indian Institute of Technology,
                  Madras (IITM). The professor’s expertise is in the area of ion channels and their structure- function
                  relationships.<br><strong>Reason for approach: </strong>We approached him to gain insights about
                  working on cellular processes involving ion transport and signaling especially with respect to the
                  Calcium ions involved in the Calcification process.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>He gave
                  insights about how to think about the calcification enhancement through activation of specific Ca+2
                  receptors. We learnt about the concept of ‘optogenetics’,
                  where specific wavelengths of light can be used to open certain ion channels like channel Rhodopsin-
                  to effectively increase the intracellular calcium concentration. This would allow us to have enhanced
                  control over the modified cells as compared to direct overexpression of a
                  protein.<br><strong>Integration in the project: </strong>After getting his inputs,
                  our team realized the importance of ion channels in the calcification process of E. huxleyi like the
                  calcium pumps in the coccolith vesicle and the Ca channels on the cell membrane. His emphasis on the
                  binding of proteins and role of receptors also helped us to choose Calmodulin (CaM) as our gene of
                  interest because of the role in plays in the calcium signaling pathway. This also motivated us to use
                  computational modeling to get a better understanding of the Ca+2 receptors and pumps.</p>

                  has significant experience in molecular biology and biotechnology.<br><strong>Reason for approach:
                  </strong>We wanted to understand how culturing of algae is done on lab scale as well as industrial
                  scale so we approached Prof Rajesh Patkar who has expertise in plant and fungal culturing in our
                  institute.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>He helped us understand the importance of various
                  environmental factors and nutrient mediums while growing a species. He emphasized on how even minute
                  changes in these can significantly affect the growth rates of organisms. Thus these insights helped us
                  to begin our work on optimization of the nutrient conditions for E. huxelyi cultures through modeling.

                  Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research,
                  studying marine micro and nanoplanktons and coccolithophores,
                  a very relevant area for our problem statement.<br><strong>Reason for approach: </strong>Through this
                  discussion,
                  our main aim was to gain insights into culturing E. huxleyi on a laboratory as well as industrial
                  scale,
                  and understanding how to determine the conditions for it. We also wanted to learn about techniques to
                  quantify the calcification. To gain insights into how to culture E. huxleyi,
                  we discussed with Dr. Shramik about his work on RCC1355 and other coccolithophores,
                  telling about what conditions were used by him for his experiment. Information on the strain and the
                  environment where it has been taken from is necessary to decide the conditions for
                  culturing.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>They shared papers with us that had data about
                  coccolith mass and size,
                  correlating it with the CaCO3 content. They also talked about a study of their own involving coccolith
                  mass variation with factors such as pH,
                  irradiance and temperature.<br><strong>Integration in the project: </strong>Their work on E. huxleyi
                  and knowledge about it in terms of its morphology and in context of its growth in the local natural
                  environment helped us in our population modelling. We were able to incorporate a calcification process
                  in the organism while also considering the growth impacting environmental factors.</p>

                  international judge for iGEM in the past.<br><strong>Reason for approach: </strong>To gain a better
                  understanding of the competition in terms of what areas we should focus on and how we should direct
                  our work,

                  a tech company which focuses on algae-based products and technologies within India.<br><strong>Reason
                    for approach: </strong>We decided to contact them since they had industrial experience in developing
                  algal based products and could give insights on how we could possibly upscale it from the lab
                  environment.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>It was advised to us that we should specifically
                  point out the geographical locations where our strain of marine algae is obtained from and functions.
                  This would be beneficial as we will be able to recognise which conditions are to be used for the
                  algae. With regards to upscaling,
                  we were asked to keep a number of backup systems and cultures. This would be useful in the case of a
                  culture collapsing due to unexpected conditions as there would be other cultures which would still be
                  capturing carbon. While scaling up,
                  we would need to make sure that we replicate every small component of the lab
                  scale.<br><strong>Integration in the project: </strong>The meet was very insightful for us and helped
                  us to make our solution more detailed while also educating us about some basic aspects of upscaling to
                  industrial processes. We also did the geographical location study of the E. huxleyi blooms around the

                  a seaweed company that focuses on cultivating and processing tropical seaweed
                  species.<br><strong>Reason for approach: </strong>We had a meet with her as she had knowledge about
                  cultivation of seaweed and algae while also possessing knowledge about the iGEM
                  competition.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>During our meeting with Sri Sailaja Nori from Sea6
                  Energy,
                  we received valuable feedback on how to position our iGEM project as a foundational advance in
                  synthetic biology. We were advised to present the biobrick we are designing as a tool that future
                  teams can build upon,
                  emphasizing its wide range of potential applications across various industries. By doing so,
                  we contribute meaningfully to the iGEM community by creating a resource that can be adapted for
                  various synthetic biology challenges. Additionally,
                  we were told about why not to use bioreactors or artificial ponds for microalgae culturing,
                  as this would necessitate lab-scale proof of concept and specific numerical data,
                  which we are not yet equipped to provide.<br><strong>Integration in the project: </strong>This

                  carbon capture methods utilised in the steel industry and has put efforts in making innovative
                  technology for the same.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>He emphasized the challenge of
                  converting CO2 into useful chemicals due to the high enthalpy required,
                  advocating for the use of green hydrogen as an energy source. He shared details of pilot projects
                  utilizing physical and chemical adsorption methods for CO2 capture,
                  such as the Cold Methanol and Methyl Diamine processes. A notable point was the potential of
                  algae-based carbon capture,
                  despite its high resource demands. He stressed the importance of improving the efficiency of
                  biological pathways,
                  such as the calcification process in algae,
                  and the necessity of looping calcium for sustainability.<br><strong>Integration in the project:
                  </strong>His inputs helped us look into possible industries in which we could integrate our solution,
                  thus beginning our analysis of the Cement Industry which needs Calcium Carbonate as its raw material
                  and generates a significant carbon footprint during its operation. This interview also highlighted the
                  need for precise thermodynamic and kinetic calculations to optimize carbon capture processes and
                  enhance their scalability.<br>On similar lines,
                  we also received inputs from several professors including Prof. Santosh Narohna from the chemical

                  feasible.<br><strong>Inputs received: </strong>He gave the team an overview of the typical industrial
                  clinker process,
                  and what are the requirements of the calcium carbonate feed that is used for the same. This helped us
                  understand how our end product will need to be modified to suit their needs. We also got to learn
                  about the upscaling strategies used for industrial applications and how cement plants are usually set

                <p>During the onsite visit,
                  our team got to understand the detailed overview of the cement manufacturing process and the quality
                  control involved in the same. We learnt about the two kinds of cement OPC and PPC. Our main question
                  for them was to know what all quality parameters will need to be met in order to integrate our
                  biobased calcium carbonate as the raw material for the clinker process. This led us to gain in depth
                  insights about how the industry has strict requirements to meet the official standards set by the
                  government. They strongly advised us to look into the current standards and get a perspective on the
                  kind of raw material the industry is mandated to use for its operation. Based on this input,
                  our team studied the website of Bureau of Indian Standards (<a href="www.bis.gov.in">Click here</a>)
                  and found the IS 18189 : 2023 standard which specifies the raw materials for the cement industry :</p>

                <p>Thus we realized that CaCO3 produced by E. huxleyi will need to be a form that adheres to this
                  standard in order for it to be an acceptable raw material for the Indian Cement Industry. Thus we
                  decided to look closely into the coccolith structures and characteristics of the CaCO3 we will be
                  producing so that it can be potentially integrated as a viable technological solution.<br>These
                  interactions helped us to gain the perspective of the industrial stakeholders and their requirements.

                <p><strong>Description of person: </strong>She had valuable expertise as the Co-Head of the Dry Lab team
                  of the IISER Mohali iGEM team.<br><strong>Reason for approach: </strong>While attempting to model
                  calcification in our algae,
                  there were several major challenges that we were getting stuck at. So we decided to discuss how to
                  deal with the complexities of modeling biological systems with Riya.<br><strong>Inputs received:
                  </strong>This meeting was an important step where the team was able to understand the correct way to
                  approach this complex modeling problem. We learnt that it is crucial to break down the problem into
                  parts and compartmentalize the system based on the functions. We can then compare these to analogous
                  processes in other organisms. For example developing the calcium deposition pathway based on the bone
                  mineralization process in humans and calcification in oysters. We also learnt how to deal with the
                  data scarcity issues of E. huxleyi by looking at relative changes using approximations instead of
                  scarce absolute data. This meeting was crucial in helping us gain a correct starting point to model
                  our complex process and helped us understand how to focus on individual components of the biological
                  system and integrate them based on their dependencies to predict our desired output.</p>

                <h3 id="section-14-subsection-15-0">Meeting with the iGEM Teams of IIT Delhi and IIT Roorkee</h3>
                <p>As our team is participating for the first time in the iGEM Competition,
                  we recognized the importance of learning from those with prior experience. To gain deeper insights and
                  understand the intricacies of the competition,
                  we reached out to the iGEM teams from IIT Delhi and IIT Roorkee. Both teams were incredibly
                  supportive,
                  offering advice that has been beneficial in our approach to the project.<br>These meetings provided us
                  with a broad understanding of how we should structure our efforts,
                  from project planning to execution,
                  while emphasizing the significance of stakeholder engagement. Additionally,
                  the teams highlighted the importance of making our project useful and accessible to future iGEM
                  teams.<br>We also took part in the All India iGEM Meet which took place in IISc Bangalore. This was a
                  great and positive learning experience for us as we got to interact with iGEM teams from all over
                  India and learn from their ideas and presentations about how to develop an idea further,
                  things to keep in mind and many more tips. We also received valuable feedback on our project and
                  presentation from the judges present there,
                  not just for now but also for years to come !</p>
